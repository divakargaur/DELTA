/* 
CSS: Cascading StyleSheets
--------------------------
The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.
-> h2 {}
-> h2 {} <- final property will be valid


Selector Specificity
--------------------
Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.
-> inline-specificity > id > class/attribute/pseudo-class > element/pseudo-element
-> more selectors > less selectors <- good practice
-> if specificity is same we compare cascade algorithm
-> we usually don't use inline specificity


-> !important <- it will not change in any case
